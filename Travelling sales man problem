Travelling sales man problem
Created a custom code to solve the famous Travelling saleman Problem. The solution was an implementation of Simulated annealing with precisely tuned number of modification.\\
The code was made in c++ and no STL was used to keep the solution computationally light.



what I have done: wrote python script to find optimal parameters.
